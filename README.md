# Codewars-Problems
Set of problems from codewars about certain programming solutions. Code is in python or C++

Array Difference
----------------

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

Bit Counting
------------

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

Build a Tower
----------------

Build Tower

Build Tower by the following given argument:
number of floors (integer and always greater than 0).

Tower block is represented as *

    Python: return a list;
    JavaScript: returns an Array;
    C#: returns a string[];
    PHP: returns an array;
    C++: returns a vector<string>;
    Haskell: returns a [String];
    Ruby: returns an Array;
    Lua: returns a Table;

Have fun!

for example, a tower of 3 floors looks like below

[
  '  *  ', 
  ' *** ', 
  '*****'
]

and a tower of 6 floors looks like below

[
  '     *     ', 
  '    ***    ', 
  '   *****   ', 
  '  *******  ', 
  ' ********* ', 
  '***********'
]

Counting Duplicates
-------------------

Count the number of Duplicates

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
Example

"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice

Create Phone Number
-------------------

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example:

create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

Descending Order
----------------

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:

Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

Disemvowel Trolls
-----------------

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Duplicate Encoder
-----------------

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
Examples

"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 

Notes

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!

Even or Odd
-----------

Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

Filling an Array part 1
-----------------------

We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents!

Write a function that produces an array with the numbers 0 to N-1 in it.

For example, the following code will result in an array containing the numbers 0 to 4:

arr(5) // => [0,1,2,3,4]

Find the Odd int
----------------

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Find the Pairity Outlier
------------------------

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
Examples

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)

Get The Middle Character
------------------------

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

Grasshopper Summation
---------------------

Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

Highest and Lowest
------------------

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example:

high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes:

    All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
    There will always be at least one number in the input string.
    Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

Moving Zeros To The End
-----------------------

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

move_zeros([False,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) # returns[False,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]

Multiples of 3 or 5
-------------------

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

    Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

Persistent Bugger
-----------------

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:

persistence(39) => 3  # Because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                       # and 4 has only one digit.

persistence(999) => 4 # Because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                       # 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2.

persistence(4) => 0   # Because 4 is already a one-digit number.

Quarter of the Year
-------------------

Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

Remove the first and last characters
------------------------------------

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

Remove String Spaces
--------------------

Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

Replace With Alphabet Position
------------------------------

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.
Example

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (as a string)

Reverse Words
-------------

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"

Shortest Word
-------------

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

Square Every Digit
-----------------

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer


String Repeat
-------------

Write a function called repeat_str which repeats the given string src exactly count times.

repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

Sum of Digits
-------------

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
Examples

    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
    942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
    132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
    493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

Sum of Positive
---------------

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

Take a Ten Minute Walk
----------------------

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

    Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

The Hashtag Generator
---------------------

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

    It must start with a hashtag (#).
    All words must have their first letter capitalized.
    If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
    If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

Examples

" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false

Vowel Count
-----------

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

Who Likes It?
-------------

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes([]) # must be "no one likes this"
likes(["Peter"]) # must be "Peter likes this"
likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) # must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) # must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) # must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.

Your Order Please
-----------------

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
Examples

"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""
