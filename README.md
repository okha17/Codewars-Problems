# Codewars-Problems
Set of problems from codewars about certain programming solutions. Code is in python or C++

Even or Odd
-----------

Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

Filling an Array part 1
-----------------------

We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents!

Write a function that produces an array with the numbers 0 to N-1 in it.

For example, the following code will result in an array containing the numbers 0 to 4:

arr(5) // => [0,1,2,3,4]

Find the Pairity Outlier
------------------------

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
Examples

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)

Get The Middle Character
------------------------

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

Grasshopper Summation
---------------------

Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

Highest and Lowest
------------------

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example:

high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes:

    All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
    There will always be at least one number in the input string.
    Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

Quarter of the Year
-------------------

Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

Remove the first and last characters
------------------------------------

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

Remove String Spaces
--------------------

Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

String Repeat
-------------

Write a function called repeat_str which repeats the given string src exactly count times.

repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

Sum of Positive
---------------

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

Vowel Count
-----------

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

Who Likes It?
-------------

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes([]) # must be "no one likes this"
likes(["Peter"]) # must be "Peter likes this"
likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) # must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) # must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) # must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.
